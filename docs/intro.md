# Welcome to ACE HPC

The African Centre of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Intensive Sciences (ACE) operates a high-performance computing cluster designed to accelerate research across bioinformatics, computational biology, and data-intensive sciences throughout Africa.

## What is HPC?

High-Performance Computing (HPC) enables researchers to tackle computational problems that would be impossible or impractical on standard computers. Our cluster provides:

- **Parallel Processing**: Run hundreds of calculations simultaneously
- **Large Memory**: Analyze datasets that exceed typical computer limits
- **Specialized Hardware**: Access GPUs and high-core-count processors optimized for scientific computing
- **Persistent Storage**: Store and share large research datasets securely

## Who Should Use ACE HPC?

Our cluster serves researchers who need to:

- Analyze genomic sequences and perform bioinformatics workflows
- Run molecular dynamics simulations and protein structure predictions
- Process large-scale datasets that exceed desktop computer capabilities
- Execute computationally intensive statistical analyses
- Train machine learning models on biological data

## Getting Started
